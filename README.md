# Multi-Agent System for Network Performance Optimization Using Ray and RLlib

This project presents a simulation framework for an edge-native Multi-Agent System (MAS) that performs anomaly detection and adaptive Quality of Service (QoS) optimization in network environments. It leverages the Ray framework and RLlib for scalable reinforcement learning and multi-agent orchestration. The analysis is based on pre-collected 5G network performance logs.

## Project Description

The notebook implements a MAS architecture consisting of:

- **Monitoring Agents**: Extract and preprocess network performance metrics from structured log data.
- **Anomaly Detection Agents**: Identify deviations in key performance indicators such as latency, packet loss, and throughput.
- **Optimization Agents**: Apply reinforcement learning to learn policies that dynamically respond to performance anomalies.

The goal is to simulate intelligent agents capable of improving QoS in latency-sensitive industrial network environments.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Ray >= 2.0
- RLlib
- Gym
- NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## Installation

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-mas-rl
   cd network-mas-rl
````

2. Install required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook MAS_Ray_RLlib_withNEwdata.ipynb
   ```

## Methodology

* **Data Ingestion**: Load and preprocess static network logs.
* **Environment Design**: Define custom Gym environments for agents interacting with the network state space.
* **Training**: Use RLlib (e.g., PPO, DQN) to train agents to detect anomalies and propose QoS adjustments.
* **Evaluation**: Analyze reward convergence, anomaly frequency, and response efficiency.

## Key Features

* Modular MAS architecture based on role separation
* Ray-based agent parallelization for scalability
* Integration with structured datasets for offline simulation
* Visualization of performance trends and learning dynamics

## Potential Extensions

* Support for real-time data ingestion via streaming interfaces
* Deployment to edge devices using Ray clusters
* Integration with digital twin simulations for closed-loop testing
